# DBMS_CP

### In this project, we are going to design and implement a small-scale relational database management system (DBMS). 
- Data: any information worth preserving, most likely in electronic form. 
- Database: a collection of data, organized for access and modification, preserved over a long period. 
- Query: an operation that extracts specified data from the database. 
- Relation: an organization of data into a two-dimensional table, where rows (tuples) represent basic entities or facts of some sort, and columns (attributes) represent properties of those entities. 
- Schema: a description of the structure of the data in a database, often called "metadata."


### User will be able
- To create and delete the schemas for the database tables. The schema will contain the name of the table, the columns of the table , and the allowable range of domains for columns (constraints) of the table, etc. 
- To insert and to delete the records. 
- To update of values of the attributes of records. 
- To retrieval of data that may involve one or more tables. 
- To Deny or abort any operations that would cause the schema integrity constraints to be violated. 
- To report syntactic, or semantic errors involved in any (SQL) commands.
